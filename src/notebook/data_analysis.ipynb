      "|The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.3 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the cityâ€™s surrounding waterways. The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $10B of active construction contracts and another $3B of planning and design contracts under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  NYCDEPâ€™s commitment to sustainable storm water management has led to creative methods of conveyance and disposal of storm water in the combined sewer areas throughout the city. The Green Infrastructure Section of the In-House Design (IHD) Division is responsible for the design and construction of alternative methods of storm water management called Best Management Practices (BMPs) with the goal of reducing the volume of storm water entering the combined sewers, reducing the frequency of the combined sewer overflow events and improving the quality of the storm discharge to the surrounding water bodies.    The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction seeks to hire a Project Manager Intern for In-House Designâ€™s Green Infrastructure group, located in our Lefrak Office in Queens, NY. Under supervision of the Accountable Manager of Green Infrastructure, the selected candidate will assist in the delivery of green infrastructure capital projects through the design, procurement and construction phases by overseeing consultants, in coordination with other managing agencies for the implementation of green infrastructure sites in the City Right of Way program. Work shall include conducting desktop and site assessments to determine locations of green infrastructure, review of plans and specifications for right of way bioswales, green strips, storm water green streets, infiltration basins and porous pavement as well as coordinating with construction contractors and construction managers during the construction phase.  **** Only those applicants with permanent Civil Service status as a Project Manager Intern or applicants that have applied for the civil service exam # 6055 are eligible to apply to this JVN. If you do not have permanent civil service status as a Project Manager Intern or have not applied for the civil service test, please do not apply to this position as you will not be considered for an interview.****                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

      "|The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) enriches the environment and protects public health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and storm water, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution.  DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâ€™s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The overall objective of the Division of Connections and Permitting is the protection of the New York City environment by means of the protection of the New York City water supply and sewer systems. Regulation of connections to the New York City water supply system is necessary in order to minimize the possibility of reduced water pressure, contamination of the city water supply due to cross connections, damage to the city water supply system due to water hammer and also to insure adequate fire protection within buildings in accordance with the Department of Buildings requirements. In addition, regulation of connections to the New York City sewer system is necessary in order to minimize the possibility of excessive discharge into the city sewer system, damage to the city sewer system due to improperly constructed connections, and backup and /or flooding onto streets and/or private property due to inadequate size or slope of connections.
